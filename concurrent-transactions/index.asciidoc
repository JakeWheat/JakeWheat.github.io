= concurrent transactions

== stuff

The only reason to implement concurrent transactions is
performance. Set up a fake concurrent transaction system using an
exclusive lock, and add benchmark tests for concurrent access
scenarios.

First step is to allow multiple updates at the same time so they all
save OK when there is no conflicts. Then add conflict detection.

Implementation possibilities: main two are: mvcc, update in place with
rollback log.

have to continue to maintain multistatement transactions, rollback and
recovery.

Then can consider adding ddl to transactions.
