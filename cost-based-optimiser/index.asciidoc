== stuff

cost based optimiser. Start by setting up some benchmarks

talk about different implementations like stream/hash agg,
ninlj,inlj,hj,smj, etc.

show some speed difference by manually changing trees and choosing the
right implementation

do some demos of a cost based optimiser:

* simple stats/histograms
* row count estimates
* tree cost estimates
* tree enumerator

try to get a good optimised tree without worrying about optimising the
optimiser first

then try to optimise the optimiser so we break even or better

can also put in other optimisation ideas here: lots of simple tree
rewrites, constant expression evaluation, cse?, cte->temp table or
rewind, etc.
