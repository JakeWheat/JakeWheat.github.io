= simple durable storage

== stuff

Implement a simple storage which saves to disk after every update.

No recovery or transactions.

Start with Ints only, and:

insert, update, delete, create table, drop table
maybe select * only query?

single threaded only

no nulls

milestones:

more types + nullable (maybe start with Dynamic?)

catalog

see if there is a simple way to do type extensibility

alter table?

memory only operation

add constraints?

add sequences, default?

optimise to not save the whole database on every update

change the saving layer to avoid leaving the database corrupt

This will provide the basis for the single threaded transactions
implementation
