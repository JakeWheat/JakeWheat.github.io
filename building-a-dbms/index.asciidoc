= Building a DBMS

== notes

We have a concurrent transactions storage layer, and a queries
implementation which will plug into the storage layer. What else do we
need to build a minimal sql dbms?

* network code
* sessions/connections
* client driver + command line client for testing

This is in addition to the existing:

* sql compiler
* sql statement engine
* sql transactional storage engine
* tests from the transaction and queries projects

What about SQL things that haven't been implemented yet?

a proper catalog, views, triggers, functions, procedures, psm,
domains, cursors, merge, schemas and databases, structured types,
assertion, sequence (encodings, collations: probably already done in
uq, dynamic sql, connection management?, session management?,
diagnostics?
